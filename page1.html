    <p>Their are two different cards in soccer when a player fouls another player or breaks a rule in soccer. First their is the yellow card, which is a warning. Nextly, their is the red card, which gets the player sent off from the field and leaving the team with ten people, instead of 11. Also, if a player gets two yellows in a game then that equals a red card and also gets sent off. It is very rare for a player to get a direct red card in a game, but yellow cards happens almost every game.</p>

    <h2>Where it all started</h2>
    <p>It has been said that the Romans and Ancient Greeks played many ball games that involved the use of their feet. An on-going theme about sport back long ago seems to be the high level of violence in which these games were played at.Perhaps earlier versions of soccer were played as far back as the second century BC where the Chinese would play a rather dull kicking game. Many warriors (including the Ancient Greeks) would use soccer related games in preperation for battle.Furthermore, it appeared the Chinese military as far back as 3000 years ago played a game called cuju (kick-ball). Cuju involved kicking a leather ball through a type of goal made from bamboo canes and silk cloth.  </p>
    <p> One memorable part of the history of soccer came in the first world war. England and Germany were fighting on the Western front until Christmas Eve 1915 when a temporary truce took place between the countries. From somewhere a 'football' was thrown out and both Englishmen and the Germans began a free-for-all soccer game.</p>

    There are many games a long time ago that were recorded and to be like soccer, however, many of these games do not have the attributes of Soccer today. So it is still to be decided the origin of Soccer. Many people say China started it back in 3000 BC, however, others say it started when FIFA made because the rules made are the rules we play by today.

  <p>During the Warring States Period (476-221 BC), Cuju was used as fitness training for military cavaliers. The popularity of Cuju spread from the army to the royal courts and upper classes in the Han Dynasty, during 206 BC-220 AD. It is said that the Han emperor Wu Di enjoyed the sport very much, and matches were often held inside the imperial palace. It was also during the Han Dynasty that Cuju games were standardized and rules were established. A type of court called Ju Chang was built especially for Cuju matches, which had six crescent shaped goal posts at each end. </p>
