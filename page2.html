    <p>Although the US isn't known for being very good at soccer, the US national team last world cup (2014) made it all the way up to the round of 16, losing to the soon to be world champions: Germany. Even though the U.S did very good in 2014, they sadly didn't make the world cup in Russia for 2018. Hopefully as time grows, the U.S national soccer team will improve and maybe one day win the world cup. </p>

    <h2>When did the U.S start to play?</h2>
    <p>
         After the demise of college soccer in 1876, working class communities in the US adopted the game, taking on the rugby/gridiron form of soccer. It is interesting to note that this trend took place at the same time in Europe and the US. The development could be seen in New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City, also spreading rapidly to Fall River and New Redford (MA) by 1870s. The game also clashed with the popular sport of baseball in the US, considered as American past time.

      Beginning in the early 1890s, soccer witnessed an average growth in Denver, Cincinnati, Cleveland and even San Francisco and Los Angeles by the end of the century. Owing to corporate sponsorships, some leagues in America attained semi-pro statistics. The American League of Professional Football collapsed owing to heavy financial losses during its first season. In 1904, FIFA was established and was seen as lack of any national organizing association in the US. After FIFA refused an American application for membership during their 1912 congress, the speedily growing AAFA members formed the United States Football Association, which was accepted by FIFA. The main aim of the association was to end the struggle between amateur and professional soccer organizations.  </p>
