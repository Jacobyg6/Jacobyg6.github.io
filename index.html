    <h2>Cards in Soccer</h2>

    <p>Their are two different cards in soccer when a player fouls another player or breaks a rule in soccer. First their is the yellow card, which is a warning. Nextly, their is the red card, which gets the player sent off from the field and leaving the team with ten people, instead of 11. Also, if a player gets two yellows in a game then that equals a red card and also gets sent off. It is very rare for a player to get a direct red card in a game, but yellow cards happens almost every game.</p>

    <h2>What is Soccer?</h2>
    <p>What is soccer? Soccer is a sport mainly played with your feet. The goalie however, can use his hands to stop a shot. The main goal in a soccer match is to score as many goals into the opponents net within the time limit. In professional soccer, each game is around 90 minutes depending on the match. The game can go into overtime if both teams haven't scored. This only happens if it is a very important game and their must be a winner. Each team had 11 players on the field, including the goalie. Each team also has benchwarmers that can go on later in the game. In professional soccer, each team can only substitute a starting player with a benchwarmer three times.  </p>
    <p>Over time, soccer has become one the most popular sports in the world. Unlike most sports, basicially every country in the world play soccer.  During the previous world cup (2014), it is estimated that 3.2 billion people watched the world cup. That is equal to about 44 percent of the worlds population during that time. Soccer has by far become the most viewed and most popular sport played in the world.</p>
